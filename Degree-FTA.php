                                            <p>The Bachelor of Fine and Theatre Arts Degree Program in Filmmaking employs a total immersion approach to the subject, where students develop a powerful arsenal of skills in directing, screenwriting, cinematography, editing, and producing. Students work in all formats from 16mm and HD to 35mm and RED Dragon as they write, direct, shoot, and edit their own films. 
                                                The Living TV Film Academy's Bachelor of Fine and Theatre Art is unlike any other TV film school; it is an accelerated intensive degree program that can be completed in four years. One benefit of this is that students may begin internships or professional work from the second year while still studying in a standard bachelor's program, and of course earn and save money for tuition and expenses. It requires a rigorous schedule; students are in class or production studio for nine months of the academic year. There are short breaks between each semester of between One month and two week break and no reason for strike or disruption of academic calender. Students has opportunity for deep exploration and mastery of film making art. <br>

                                                Our BFA in Filmmaking offers a well-rounded collegiate education in the Arts and Humanities and Social and Natural Sciences, with a comprehensive study of — and practice in — the art and craft of filmmaking. During the four years of study, each student will write, shoot, direct, and edit 16 film projects of increasing complexity. In addition, students will work in key crew positions on their classmates' films. <br>

                                                BFA Filmmaking graduates will complete the program with a solid academic foundation in the arts and sciences, and an in-depth understanding of film production. They will enter the field with critical thinking and research skills developed in their academic classes as well as essential knowledge from the study of literature, art history, psychology, and philosophy. This specialized degree will prepare them to pursue their own paths in film and related fields as creative professionals. <br>
                                                
                                                <strong>BACHELOR’S OF FINE ARTS IN FILMMAKING: SEMESTERS 1-2</strong><br> 
                                                During the first year, students will learn the foundations of the art and technique of visual storytelling, including the requisite skills to write, direct, film, and edit four short films. This accelerated pace of study develops students' basic narrative and visual literacy, two skills that will be central to their success in the filmmaking BFA program. Students will also enter specialized liberal arts and sciences courses, designed to provide a foundation for a well-rounded education while also informing the artistic coursework to be completed throughout the remainder of the degree program.
                                                Liberal arts and sciences courses accompany the filmmaking courses, creating a balanced course load that emphasizes critical thinking and develops university-level writing skills.

                                                First year students improve their production and aesthetic skills. Intensive instruction, demonstration, and group sync-sound directing exercises increase students' comprehension of cinematography, producing, directorial style, editing, and collaborative and leadership skills. <br>
                                                                                            
                                                <strong>BACHELORS OF FINE AND THEATRE ARTS IN FILMMAKING: SEMESTERS 3-4 </strong><br>
                                                Year two of the BFA in filmmaking will culminate in the production of the intermediate film. These productions can be up to 15-20 minutes in length, produced on double system high definition video or color negative film. This project represents an implementation of all the knowledge learned in the first year of filmmaking school. <br>

                                                Bachelor’s candidates are expected to spend an additional 20-40 hours a week beyond class time on the production of their film projects. Production or practicum hours are considered separate from lab and lecture hours; however, they are still necessary to successfully complete the program. Living TV Academy recognizes, as should the students, that these hours will vary on a case-by-case basis.
                                                Year two students split their time between post-production on their intermediate films and advanced cinematography, screenwriting, and liberal arts classes in foundation studies and natural sciences. Completed projects should show artistic maturity compared with the work of the previous year. Advanced equipment — such as the Red camera — is introduced, increasing capabilities for future projects. A course in critical film studies provides a context for student filmmakers to draw upon as they complete their first feature scripts. <br>

                                                Year two students will be asked to undertake projects of increasing complexity in an on-set mentoring class, where students bring craft and theory together in production exercises. Students will film a spec commercial, and prep work begins on the scripts for students' thesis films. <br>

                                                <strong>BACHELOR’S OF FINE AND THEATRE ARTS IN FILMMAKING: SEMESTERS 5-6 </strong> <br>
                                                The overall goal of the third year of the filmmaking BFA program is to challenge students to grow as film artists and help prepare them for thesis film production in semester eight. The production of a music video will broaden students' cinematic abilities as they complete the final draft of their thesis scripts. The advanced directing project will further develop student filmmakers’ ability to create dynamic and realistic performances on set. <br>

                                                Semester 5-6 of the filmmaking BFA program is dedicated to the production of student thesis films. These thesis films are the capstone project of the BFA program, putting into practice the skills acquired throughout the previous  semesters.

                                                This semester provides an opportunity for students to complete post-production on their thesis films and expand their knowledge of the entertainment industry. They will also receive instruction on how to produce their own projects outside of a film school environment. <br>
