                            <h4>FILM MAKING</h4>
                            <p class="subheading text-muted">Beyond the theory and history of cinema, the Living TV Film Academy places an emphasis on hands-on experience. Students gain invaluable experience directing and shooting their own films and serving as integral crewmembers on other students' films. 
                                In their numerous projects, students take on roles such as director, cinematographer, writer and editor and experience first-hand what it's like to be a part of a film production.
                                 This hands-on experience in writing, directing, shooting, and editing is a large part of what makes the Living TV Film Academy the best film school for so many students.
                                The Film Academy offers innumerable opportunities for students to take full advantage of the many unique and singular locations offered by the city. From the first day of class, students take their cameras out in the city, gaining crucial knowledge in framing shots, using natural and direct lighting, and other essential techniques.</p>

                            <h4>PRODUCING</h4>
                            <p class="subheading text-muted">No single position has more to do with the creative, technical, and financial aspects of making a film or TV show than the producer. They hire and they fire and work hand in hand with film studios and TV networks. They develop the material, hire the writers, and find the buyers and financiers. They oversee script development, casting, hiring of the crew, locations, distribution, film festivals, and so much more. Ultimately, the producer is the most involved with a project through every phase (from pre-production to production and post-production).
                            In Living TV Film Academy's producing programs, you learn strong project management skills without requiring a business school background. In addition, students complete a professional-level, comprehensive production book for a feature length film that will allow you to approach investors and other industry professionals with your exciting post-LTFA project the day you graduate.

                            <p class="subheading text-muted">Cinematography refers to the art and technology of motion-picture. 
                            A cinematographer handles the responsibility and techniques involved in scene composition; lighting of location or set; lenses, choices of cameras; camera angles as well as movement; effects and filters.
                                The cinematographer is assisted by a sizeable crew as he/she cannot achieve these functions alone.</p>

                            <p class="subheading text-muted">In the film-making industry, Editors are relied on to translate the storytelling to a finely finished film with their editing skills. 
                                most Directors work with an experienced editor who sees their interpretation of a script and helps bring it to life for the viewers.
                                The Living TV Film Academy’s Digital Editing program provide students with hands-on instruction in editing theory, techniques and the fundamentals of digital editing. Students gain hands-on experience by editing various projects with footage provided to them in class.
                                 They also learn various theoretical concepts of editing and how to practically apply those theories.</p>
